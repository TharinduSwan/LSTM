# LSTM
LSTM models (stacked LSTM and CNN LSTM) with a supervised learning approches of Input parameters and auto-regressive approaches

The cross-validation integrated HPO (Hyperparameter tuning) are setup to execute in the SCW sunbird (in the scratch folder, cd /scratch/s.*****/scw_HPO/.......)
The model development (retraining, validation and testing on the prediction period) is mainly done at the personal working directory (two)
